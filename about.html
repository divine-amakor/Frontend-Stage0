        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-bio">
          I'm Amakor Divine, a final-year Industrial Mathematics and Computer Science student 
          with a deep passion for artificial intelligence, financial technology, and full-stack 
          development. My journey in tech began with curiosity about how mathematical models 
          can solve real-world problems, leading me to explore the intersection of mathematics 
          and computer science.

        <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-goals">
          Through this program, I aim to strengthen my frontend development skills and build 
          production-ready applications. I want to master modern web technologies, improve 
          my understanding of user experience design, and develop the ability to create 
          accessible, responsive web applications that solve real problems for users.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p data-testid="test-about-confidence">
          I'm still building confidence in advanced CSS animations and complex state management 
          in JavaScript applications. Additionally, I sometimes struggle with optimizing 
          performance for large-scale applications and implementing comprehensive testing 
          strategies. These are areas I'm actively working to improve.

        <p data-testid="test-about-future-note">
          Remember that every expert was once a beginner. The challenges you face today in 
          understanding complex algorithms or debugging tricky code are stepping stones to 
          becoming the developer you aspire to be. Stay curious, keep building, and never 
          stop learning. Your mathematical background is your superpower in tech.
